# Abstract

The housing market offers great opportunities to those who know how to take advantage of them. In this document we propose a spatial statistical study of the price of housing aimed both at obtaining an accurate prediction and at ensuring that said prediction is based on a solid and stable statistical model throughout the space; guaranteeing acceptable results even when trying to predict based on the data of a new house, totally unrelated to those used in the modeling phase.
Thanks to these techniques, we intend to offer a different point of view, basing our study on the influence that the price of a house suffers due to the value of its neighboring homes, and thus proposing a new framework of work and research little explored compared to other more traditional statistical models used for this topic.

# Data Cleaning & Transformation
Data downloaded over time (API requests) as JSON files with [Idealista_API.R](Idealista_API.R), then unified all records and deleted duplicates (by propertyCode), and finally converted to DataFrame with [JSON2DF.ipynb](JSON2DF.ipynb) on Google Colab.
<br><br>
Made sure that all datatypes are appropriate (e.g. size = number, district = character).

# Dashboard Data Sources

Data sources which are especifically used for the Shiny Dashboard.

- <b>final_df.rds</b>: DataFrame of consolidated data.

- <b>final_df_scaled.rds</b>: scaled/normalized DataFrame of consolidated data.

- <b>final_model.rds</b>: Final statistical model.

- <b>leaflet_data.Rda</b>: DataFrame with all visual data for the interactive leaflet.
